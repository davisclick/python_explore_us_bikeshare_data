# Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This Python script is written for Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python
 Nanodegree and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Project files
- **bikeshare.py** - final project
- **data/chicago.zip** - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
- **data/new_york_city.zip** - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
- **data/washington.zip** - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
